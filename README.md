# GRAVEYARD PROJECTüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: useless team


### Team Members
- Team Lead:Anna Mariya Babu - Jyothi Engineering College
- Member 2: T Harsha Ramesh - Jyothi Engineering college


### Project Description
A resting place for our half-baked ideas, abandoned apps, and ambitious plans that didn‚Äôt survive the sprint. Each project here died with potential ‚Äî and maybe a few bugs.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Countless unfinished projects were left without a final resting place. This lack of closure was emotionally inconvenient. We fixed that.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a digital graveyard to showcase our incomplete and abandoned projects. Rather than letting them disappear into forgotten folders, we gave them a permanent home ‚Äî a place to reflect, laugh, and occasionally question our decision-making.
